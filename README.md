# Smart Crop Predictor 🌱

**A Machine Learning-based system for recommending the best crop for farming.**

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Crop Predictor** uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to determine the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental factors such as soil type, rainfall, temperature, and pH levels. This helps enhance agricultural decision-making and productivity.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts the best crop based on soil and climatic conditions
- Implements **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithms
- Provides data-driven insights for farmers
- Scalable and easy-to-use

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)** 🤖
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing 📊
- **Flask** (for web-based predictions) 🌍
